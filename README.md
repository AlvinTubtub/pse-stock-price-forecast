# ForecastPH

ForecastPH is an educational forecasting platform for selected companies listed on the Philippine Stock Exchange (PSE). It validates official end-of-day OHLCV data, evaluates three forecasting model families against a Naive benchmark, refits production models, and publishes next-session forecasts to a Next.js website.

Forecasts are statistical estimates for education and research. They are not investment advice or trading signals.

## Companies and sectors

The configured universe is defined once in `backend/config/companies.py`.

| Sector | Companies |
| --- | --- |
| Financials | BPI, MBT, SECB |
| Industrial | JFC, MER, SHLPH |
| Mining and Oil | APX, NIKL, SCC |
| Property | ALI, MEG, SMPH |
| Services | GLO, ICT, PGOLD |

## Forecasting models

ForecastPH evaluates:

- **Lag-Informed Regression (LIR):** LASSO regression over causal lag, return, volume, range, and technical-indicator features.
- **ARIMA:** a univariate Close-series model selected from a bounded, configuration-driven order grid.
- **LSTM:** a univariate PyTorch sequence model over historical daily Close changes.
- **Naive benchmark:** predicts that the next Close equals the current Close.

LIR, ARIMA, and LSTM are the three deployable principal models. Naive is an evaluation benchmark only.

## Methodology

For every company, the backend constructs one-step forecast pairs:

```text
origin_date  = Date[t]
target_date  = Date[t+1]
target_delta = Close[t+1] - Close[t]
```

The latest approximately 15% of target dates are reserved for evaluation and the earlier approximately 85% are used for development. The split is generated dynamically from the available raw data; it is not tied to a fixed date or row count.

All four methods are evaluated on the same chronological target dates. Model tuning uses expanding-window validation without shuffling, and preprocessing is fitted only on the applicable training block. The backend reports RMSE, MAE, MASE, and R². MASE uses one development-series denominator per company.

Principal models are ranked by evaluation RMSE. Evaluation remains separate from production refitting: after configurations are selected, all three principal models are freshly refitted on all currently available validated history.

## Production architecture

```text
Official PSE OHLCV
        ↓
strict raw-data validation
        ↓
chronological tuning and evaluation
        ↓
full-data production refit
        ↓
persisted production-model artifacts
        ↓
daily PSE EOD ingestion and validation
        ↓
persisted-model inference without retraining
        ↓
atomic frontend JSON export
        ↓
Next.js frontend on Vercel
```

`backend/data/raw/` is the sole modeling input. Generated model, evaluation, forecast, and run artifacts live under the gitignored `backend/artifacts/` tree.

## Fresh training versus daily inference

Fresh training validates raw histories, constructs the evaluation plan, tunes and evaluates all models, saves full-precision out-of-sample evidence, refits all three principal models, creates the production artifact manifest, and exports operational frontend JSON.

Daily operation downloads available PSE EOD reports, validates and idempotently merges new rows, validates the restored artifact package, loads persisted models, performs inference, and refreshes frontend JSON when raw data changed.

The daily workflow does **not** tune or refit models. It fails closed if a complete compatible production artifact package is unavailable.

## GitHub Actions

Two workflows implement production automation:

- **PSE Fresh Model Training** (`.github/workflows/train_models.yml`) runs quarterly and supports manual `workflow_dispatch`.
- **PSE EOD Update and Persisted Model Forecast** (`.github/workflows/update_pipeline.yml`) performs ingestion and persisted-model inference without training.

Quarterly fresh training is scheduled at 8:00 AM Philippine Time on February 28, May 28, August 28, and November 28.

GitHub Actions stores the complete production-model package as an artifact. Its manifest identifies and validates every expected model and evaluation file before daily inference begins.

## Backend commands

Run from `backend/` after installing `requirements.txt`:

```bash
python scripts/validate_raw.py --all --verbose
python scripts/train_all.py --all --fresh --verbose
python scripts/forecast_all.py --all --verbose
python scripts/update_eod.py --verbose
python scripts/reset_artifacts.py --yes
python -m pytest -q
```

`train_all.py --fresh` removes only generated backend artifacts before training. It never removes raw data. A single-company diagnostic run must use `--no-export`, because the production frontend contract requires the complete configured universe.

## Frontend

The frontend is a Next.js 14 App Router application. It reads committed operational JSON from `frontend/public/forecasts/`; it does not run Python or model inference on Vercel.

Current pages and features include Home, Companies, company detail charts, My Watchlist, Models, Learn Stocks, About, the AI assistant, out-of-sample backtests, forecast-error charts, and next-session forecasts.

Run locally from `frontend/`:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Production validation:

```bash
npm run build
npx tsc --noEmit
```

## Forecast data contract

The current JSON compatibility contract is documented in `docs/frontend-forecast-contract.md`. Generated operational JSON is the website's source of truth. The exporter validates the complete payload and publishes atomically so a failure cannot leave a partially updated dataset.

## Historical research

Earlier research and manuscript materials are intentionally archived under `docs/research-history/`. They are retained for academic reference only and are not imported, loaded, or generated by the active backend, frontend pages, chatbot data context, or GitHub Actions workflows.
